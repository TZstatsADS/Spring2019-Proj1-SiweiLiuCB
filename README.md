This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: Data Story: What Made You Happy Today?
+ This project is conducted by Siwei Liu

+ Project summary: In this project I analyzed data from HappyDB, which contains 100,000 happy moments via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) over 3 months. Analysis on different angles was conducted. In the end of the blog, I created some business sense according to the result of the analysis.
