### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: Data Story: What Made You Happy Today?
+ This project is conducted by Siwei Liu

+ Project summary: In this project I analyzed data from HappyDB, which contains 100,000 happy moments via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) over 3 months. Analysis on different angles was conducted. The main findings of this project is that firstly, people generally share something in common in their happy moments, such as friends, day and time. However, there exists a difference between male and female and different marital status in terms of their happy moments. Women are generally more easy to regard affection as their happy moments, whereas men tend to enjoy achievements as their happy moments more. Married people has more happy moments in the affection category. For the single, achievements might be a more frequent happy moment source than people who are in other marital status. In the end of the blog, I created some business sense according to the result of the analysis.
